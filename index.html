        <strong>
          First  what is <em> software engineering</em> Software engineering is an engineering aproach to software
         development</strong>
    </p> A practioner,called a software emgineer, applies the enginneering design process to develop software.   
</h3>
<h3> 
    Now the question is what exactly does a software engineer do? A Software engineer applies engineering principles and knowledge of programing languages to build software solutions for end users.
    They also design and develp computer games,business applications,operating systems,network control systems, and middleware-to name just a few of the may career paths available. 
</h3>
<h3> 
    Learning software engineering can be challenging due to it's dynamic and ever-changing nature, but many of these difficulties can be managed with the right 
</h3>
<h3>
    while <strong> cyber security </strong> is the practice of protecting systems,networks,an programs from digital attacks.<br>It is also the practice of protecting internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats
    These cyberattaks are usually aimed at accessing,changing,or destroying sensitive information;extorting money from users through rasomware;or interrupting normal business processes.
